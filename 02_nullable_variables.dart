// Nullable variables
// Dart 2.12 introduced sound null safety, meaning that (when you enable null safety) values can’t be null unless you say they can be. In other words, types are non-nullable by default.

// For example, consider the following code, which is invalid because (with null safety) a variable of type int can’t have the value null:

// int a = null; // INVALID in null-safe Dart.
// When creating a variable in Dart 2.12 or higher, you can add ? to the type to indicate that the variable can be null:

// int? a = null; // Valid in null-safe Dart.
// You can simplify that code a bit because, in all versions of Dart, null is the default value for uninitialized variables:

// int? a; // The initial value of a is null.
// For more information about null safety in Dart, read the sound null safety guide.
